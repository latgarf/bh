<br><h1>How Our Risk Management Products Work</h1><br>

<big>
<p>To use our products, first, you need to determine what direction of the BTC/USD exchange rate movements would be detrimental to you.
For example, if you hold bitcoins as investmets, then bitcoin depreciation would erode your value, 
hence you would want to protect yourself against a decrease in the BTC/USD rate.
&nbsp;Conversely, if you have borrowed some bitcoins, then an increase in the bitcoin price
would make the dollar value of your debt bigger.  
In this case, you would want to protect yourself from BTC/USD rate increases.</p>

<p>On our <a href="/future/">homepage</a>, select from the "Protect from" drop down menu 
the option that corresponds to your objectives.
Notice that as you change the values in the "Contract Parameters" form,
the quoted insurance fee at the bottom will change in response.
</p>

<p><br>Decide how many bitcoins you want to protect. Enter that value in the appropriate field.</p>

<p><br>Next, choose the desired expiry date and time for your contract.<br>
This is when your insurance will terminate.<br>
The expiry time has to be specified as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"><b>UTC</b></a>, the Coordinated Universal Time.<br>
Please check how many hours is the time difference 
between <a href="http://time.is/UTC">UTC</a> and <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/">your local time zone</a>.</p>

<p>Enter your chosen expiry in the appropriate form field in this format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM<br>
that is, &nbsp;2014-09-01 12:00&nbsp; for &nbsp;September 1st, 2014, 12:00 noon.</p>

<p>Please <big><u>have your bitcoin wallet ready</u></big> to receive payouts and to make insurance fee payments.</p>


<p><br>To initiate a contract, press the "Submit Order" button at the bottom of <a href="/future/">our homepage</a>.<br>
Then make your insurance fee payments within 5 minutes, when prompted.<br></p>


<br><h2>The Order Life Cycle</h2>
<p>
<ol>
	<li><h4>Specify insurance parameters</h4>
		<p>On the 	<a href="/future/">homepage</a>, in the "Contract Parameters" form,
		specify your chosen order size, expiry and<br>
		order type (whether to protect from increase or decrease in BTC/USD rate).<br></p>
		<p>Also, in this form's respective field, please paste your bitcoin address 
		where you want to receive your payouts after your order expires.</li></p>
	
	<li><h4>Press the "Submit Order" button.</h4>
		<p>After you press the "Submit Order" button, you should see a confirmation that "Your order was received".<br>
		It will also tell you the bitcoin address where to send your insurance fee payment.<br>
		If you don't see such confirmation (yellow section with red text), then please check your browser - JavaScript must be enabled.</li></p>
		
	<li><h4>Make your fee payment within 5 minutes after pressing the "Submit Order" button.</h4>
		<p>Your order is not opened until your fee payment is received.<br>
		If no payment is received within 5 minutes after you pressed the "Submit Order" button, the order is cancelled).</p>
		<p>If you pay a different amount than the quote, your order will still be opened, but the order size will be adjusted proportionally.
		For example, if the fee quoted to you for insuring 1 bitcoin was 0.02, but you have paid only 0.01,<br>
		then a contract to insure only 0.5 bitcoins will be opened.</p></li>
	
	<li><h4>Receive a payout when your order expires</h4>
		A payout that is due to you, will be sent to your bitcoin address 
		within a minute after your order expires.</li>
</ol>

<br><h2>Example</h2>
<big>
<p>Bob has been saving 2 bitcoins planning to buy a $1000 bike on the Saturday afternoon, August 23, 2014.<br>
The day before, he got concerned that if the bitcoin price drops overnight,
he may not have enough money to make the purchase.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the possible shortage of cash, he decided to insure his 2 bitcoins 
against the possible drop in the BTC/USD rate at 12noon on Friday, when the BTC/USD rate was $523.10.
To open an insurance contract, he first specified on the <a href="/future/">homepage</a>, 
the type of his desired order, "Protect from DECREASE in bitcoin value vs USD".
<br><br>
Then, Bob needed to specify his contract's expiry time.<br>
He lives in New York, so he checked that his local time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Daylight_Time">EDT</a>, was four hours behind UTC.<br>
He wanted to receive his insurance payout at 4pm on Saturday, 24th August 2014. 
Hence, he specified his desired expiry time as 2014-08-24 20:00 UTC.<br>
<p>Then, he specified that the amount he wanted to insure was 2 bitcoins.</p>
</p>
<p>Then Bob prepared his bitcoin wallet, and copied his bitcoin address 
and pasted it into the form, which now looked like this:</p>
<hr>
<img src="/static/images/bob.png" align="left" />
<br clear="all" /><br>
<hr>
<!-- <img src="/static/images/logo.gif" width="180" align="left" valign="top" hspace="0" vspace="0" /> -->

<p>Then Bob pressed the "Submit Order" button.<br>
The bitcoin address for his fee payment was displayed as a result:<br><br>
<img src="/static/images/bob-yellow.png" align="left" />
<br clear="all" /><br>
<p>Then Bob made his fee payment of 0.038 bitcoins ($19.34) to that address, <small>1Nq4USqWcKUNj3yhUiyrVfaAwgn32DrmEQ</small>.</p>

<p>When Bob's order expired at 4pm on Saturday, he received a payout of 0.129 bitcoins ($63.40) in his wallet.<br>
The BTC/USD exchange rate has dropped indeed, and the bitcoin price at expiry was $491.40.<br>
The payout amount was calculated as (523.10 - 491.40) * 2 bitcoins.</p>

<p>Bob was now able to convert his 2.129 bitcoins into $1046.20 cash, exactly the value of his 2 bitcoins 
when his insurance contract started.</p>
<p>If he had not purchased this insurance, the value of his 2 bitcoins at 4pm on Saturday would be only $982.80, 
and he would not have enough money to buy the $1000 bike.</p>

<br><h2>How to Test Our System in 10 minutes</h2>
<big><p>It takes only 10 minutes to fully experience the process of placing insurance orders, 
making and receiving the payments.</p>
<p>For this, you need to simultaneously submit two orders of the opposite types -<br> 
one order to protect against a <i>decrease</i> in BTC/USD rate and the other against an <i>increase</i>.</p>
<p>Specify the same expiry time for both orders, say 10 minutes from now.</p>
<p>For these test orders, you may choose to pay a very small insurance fee, say 0.001 bitcoins.</p>
<p>No matter the change of the BTC/USD rate, you are guaranteed to receive one payout when your orders expire in 10 minutes!</p>
<p>We appreciate if you <a href="mailto:kanom@gmx.us">email us your feedback</a>.</p>
