<br><h1>How Insurance from Bitcoin Volatility Works:</h1><br>

<big>
<ol>
	<li><b>Specify insurance parameters</b><br>
		(expiry, size, and whether to protect from increase or decrease in bitcoin rate)</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Provide your bitcoin address.</b> Your insurance payout will be sent there upon expiry.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Press "Submit Order" button.</b><br>
		Our bitcoin address will be displayed as a result.</li><br>
		
	<li><b>Make your fee payment to our address within 5 minutes</b><br>
		(otherwise, your order will be cancelled).<br>
		If you pay a differen amount than the quote, your order will still be opened, but the size will be adjusted proportionally.<br>
		For example, if the fee quoted to you for insuring 1 bitcoin was 0.02, but you have paid only 0.01,<br>
		then a contract to ensure only 0.5 bitcoins will be opened.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>After your contract expires</b><br>
		If a payment is due to you,	it will be sent to your bitcoin address within a minute.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example:</h3>

At 16:00 (4pm) on 30th of October 2013, Bob got concerned that bitcoin will lose its value against USD in the next day.
Therefore, he decided to buy insurance at that time to protect his holdings of 10 bitcoins against depreciation.
Bob specified the following parameters for his insurance contract:<br>
<br>- INSURE FROM DECREASE in bitcoin value vs USD
<br>- EXPIRY DATE: 2013-10-31
<br>- AMOUNT TO INSURE: 10 bitcoins
<br>
<br>
Bob opens his bitcoin client app<br>
and copies his bitcoin address where he wants to receive insurance payment at expiry.
